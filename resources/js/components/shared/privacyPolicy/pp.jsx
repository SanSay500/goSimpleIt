            <span>What information do we collect?</span></strong></p><p><strong>Information You
            Provide to
            Us </strong></p><p>Ironclad requires each customer to provide us with personal information (collectively
            “Personally
            Identifiable Information”) to access and use Ironclad products and services. Personally Identifiable
            Information is
            captured when a visitor accesses Online Services, or speaks on the phone with or emails an Ironclad
            employee, and
            willingly discloses that information. This disclosure may occur when a visitor registers with an Online
            Service,
            engages in transactions, contacts customer service, or participates in contests, promotions, surveys,
            forums,
            content submissions, requests for suggestions, or other aspects of services offered by Ironclad.</p>
            <p>Personally
                Identifiable Information includes: (i) “Contact Data” (such as your name, address, city, state, zip
                code, phone
                number, and email address); (ii) “Financial Data” (such as your credit card number, expiration date, and
                verification code or bank account information); (iii) “Demographic Data” (such as your zip code and
                sex).</p><p><em>Calls/Electronic
            Communications.</em> In the regular course of our business, Ironclad may monitor and record phone
            conversations or
            email communications between you and Ironclad employees for training and quality assurance purposes. We may
            receive
            a confirmation when you open or click on content in an email from us, which helps us make our communications
            to you
            more useful and interesting.</p><p><em>Surveys, Sweepstakes, and Contests.</em><strong><em> </em></strong>We
            may
            provide you the opportunity to participate in surveys on our site, to measure customer satisfaction. If you
            participate, we may request certain personally identifiable information from you. Participation in these
            surveys,
            sweepstakes, or contests is completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose
            this
            information. The requested information typically includes name, email address, and mailing address.</p><p>
            <em>Testimonials
                and Reviews. </em>We may display personal testimonials of satisfied customers. We will ask for your

            reviews.

            referring/exit pages, operating systems, date/time stamps, and clickstream data (collectively “Visitor
            Data”). The
            Ironclad internal servers and software automatically recognize Visitor Data. The Site may use Visitor Data
            to
            compile traffic data about the types of visitors who use the Site at specific intervals (collectively
            “Traffic
            Data”).</p><p>We may use Traffic Data to analyze Site traffic. We may also use Traffic Data to diagnose
            problems
            with our server, administer our Site, or display content according to your preferences. Visitor Data and
            Traffic
            Data may also be shared with business partners, affiliates, or advertisers on an aggregated and anonymous
            basis.</p>
            <p><em>Cookies. </em>Ironclad may use the standard cookie feature of major browser applications and

                Online

        </p><p>Except as disclosed here, we do not rent, sell, or share your personal information with third parties. We
            share
            customer information with third parties as follows:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Order Processing.</strong> Ironclad, sometimes with the assistance of a third party or
                    Ironclad
                    subsidiary, may use your Personally Identifiable Information to process your payment through
                    merchant
                    account services, and to generate the products and services you order. Your Contact Data may be used
                    to
                    follow up with you on transactions you initiate through Online Services, respond to inquiries made
                    through
                    Online Services, inform you of changes to Online Services, and send you additional information about
                    Ironclad and its products and services.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Third Party Marketing.</strong> Unless specifically authorized by you, we do not provide
                    Personally
                    Identifiable Information to third parties for marketing purposes. If you express interest in a third
                    party
                    offer or purchase a package that includes a third party offer, we may provide your Personally
                    Identifiable
                    Information to that third party solely in connection with the offer you have selected.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Required by Law.</strong> We may also disclose your personal information: as required by
                    law, such
                    as in response to a subpoena or similar legal process, and when we believe in good faith that
                    disclosure is
                    necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or
                    respond
                    to a legal request.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Visitor Demographics. </strong>Contact Data and Traffic Data are used to gather general
                    statistics
                    about our customers and visitors. We may use Demographic Data to generate collective information
                    about our
                    users, but not in a way that identifies any user specifically. For example, we may inform third
                    parties
                    about the number of registered users and unique visitors, and the pages most frequently browsed.

                <li><strong>Service Providers. </strong>We may share your Personally Identifiable Information with
                    companies

                    our
                    products and services. These companies may need information about you in order to perform their
                    functions.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Blogs and Forums. </strong>The Site may include a publicly accessible blog and interactive
                    forums.
                    You should be aware that any information you provide in these areas may be read, collected, and used
                    by
                    others who access them. You should use caution when deciding whether to disclose your personal
                    information
                    in these areas of the site. To request removal of your personal information from our community
                    forums,

                    and why.
                </li>

                    with
                    businesses controlling, controlled by, or under common control with Ironclad. If Ironclad is merged,
                    acquired, or sold, or if some or all of our assets or equity are transferred, we may disclose or
                    transfer
                    Personally Identifiable Information and other data in connection with the associated transactions.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Bankruptcy.</strong> In the event of an Ironclad bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
                    receivership, or assignment for the benefit of creditors, or the application of laws or equitable
                    principles
                    affecting creditors’ rights generally, we may not be able to control how your personal information
                    is
                    treated, transferred, or used. If such an event occurs, your Personally Identifiable Information may
                    be
                    treated like any other Ironclad asset and sold, transferred, or shared with third parties, or used
                    in ways
                    not contemplated or permitted under this Privacy Policy. In this case, you will be notified via
                    email and/or
                    a prominent notice on our site of any change in ownership or uses of your personal information, as
                    well as
                    any choices you may have regarding your personal information.

            <p>We receive

            for Use of
            Your Information. </strong>Our legal grounds for processing your information are as follows:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>To honor our contractual commitments to you: Much of our processing of personal data is to meet our
                    contractual obligations to our users, or to take steps at users’ requests in anticipation of
                    entering into a
                    contract with them. For example, we handle personal data on this basis to allow you to sign up for
                    our
                    Online Services.
                </li>
                <li>Consent: Where required by law, and in some other cases, we handle personal data on the basis of
                    your
                    implied or express consent.
                </li>
                <li>Legitimate interests: In many cases, we handle personal data on the ground that it furthers our
                    legitimate
                    interests in commercial activities in ways that are not overridden by the interests or fundamental
                    rights
                    and freedoms of the affected individuals. This includes: operating our business and the Online
                    Services;
                    providing security for our websites, products, software, or applications; marketing; receiving
                    payments;
                    preventing fraud; and knowing the customer to whom we are providing the Online Services.
                </li>
                <li>Legal compliance: We need to use and disclose personal data in certain ways to comply with our legal
                    obligations (such as our obligation to share data with tax authorities).
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Data Subject Rights. </strong>Residents of the European Economic Area (“EEA”), Switzerland, and
                the UK
                can exercise certain data subject rights available to them under applicable data protection laws. Where
                such
                rights apply, we will comply with requests to exercise these rights in accordance with applicable law.
                Please
                note, however, that certain information may be exempt from such requests in some circumstances, which
                may
                include if we need to keep processing your information for our legitimate interests or to comply with a
                legal
                obligation. If these rights apply to you, they may permit you to request that we:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>provide access to and/or a copy of certain information we hold about you</li>
                <li>prevent the processing of your information for direct-marketing purposes (including any direct
                    marketing
                    processing based on profiling)
                </li>
                <li>update information which is out of date or incorrect</li>
                <li>delete certain information which we are holding about you</li>
                <li>restrict the way that we process and disclose certain of your information</li>
                <li>transfer your information to a third party provider of services</li>
                <li>revoke your consent for the processing of your information</li>
            </ul>
            <p>For more information on how to exercise these rights, please contact us using the information in the
                “Contact Us”
                section below. If applicable, you may make a complaint to the data protection supervisory authority in
                the
                country where you are based. Alternatively, you may seek a remedy through local courts if you believe
                your
                rights have been breached.</p><p>In instances where we process personal information on behalf of our
            customer,
            rights requests should be directed to the relevant customer. Any request sent directly to us that pertains
            to
            information collected on behalf of a customer will be forwarded on to that customer.</p><p><strong>International
            Data Transfers.</strong> Information submitted to Ironclad will be transferred to, processed, and stored in
            the
            United States, or for certain customers, the European Union or Japan. If you post or transfer any
            information to or
            through the Online Services, you are agreeing to such information, including Personally Identifiable
            Information,
            being hosted and accessed in the United States, the European Union, and Japan. Please note that the privacy
            laws of
            the United States, the European Union, and Japan may be different from those in the place where you are a
            resident.
        </p><p>Where required, we will use appropriate safeguards for transferring data outside of the EEA, Switzerland,
            and the
            UK. This includes signing Standard Contractual Clauses that govern the transfers of such data, which may be
            used in
            conjunction with additional safeguards. For more information about these transfer mechanisms, please contact
            us as
            detailed in the “Contact us” section below.</p><p id="CA-Residents-Privacy-Notice"><strong><span
           >Supplemental Privacy Notice for California Residents</span></strong></p><p>This
            Supplemental Privacy Notice supplements the information in our Privacy Policy above, and except as provided
            herein,
            applies solely to California residents. It applies to personal information we collect on or through the
            Online
            Services and through other means (such as information collected offline, in person, and over the telephone).
            It does
            not apply to personal information we collect from our employees and job applicants in their capacity as
            employees
            and job applicants. It also does not apply to personal information we collect from employees, owners,
            directors,
            officers, or contractors of businesses in the course of our provision or receipt of business-related
            services.</p>
            <p><strong>Summary of Information We Collect</strong></p><p>If you are a California resident, California law
            requires us to provide you with some additional information regarding how we collect, use, and share your
            “personal
            information” (as defined in the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”)).</p><p>Throughout our Privacy
            Policy, we
            describe the specific pieces of personal information we collect, the sources of that information, and how we
            share
            it. Under the CCPA, we also have to provide you with the "categories" of personal information we collect and
            disclose for “business purposes” (as those terms are defined by applicable law). Those categories are
            identifiers
            (such as name, address, email address, phone number, other account information, and cookies); commercial
            information
            (such as transaction data); financial data (such as credit card and other financial account information);
            internet
            or other network or device activity (such as IP address or service usage); geolocation information (general
            location); inference data about you; sensory information (such as audio recordings if you call customer
            service);
            professional or employment related data; education data; insurance (including health insurance) information;
            medical
            information; physical characteristics or description; legally protected classifications (such as gender);
            other
            information that identifies or can be reasonably associated with you.</p><p>We collect the categories of
            personal
            information identified above from the following sources: (1) directly from you; (2) through your use of the
            Online
            Services; (3) affiliates; and (4) third parties such as social networks and other Ironclad users.</p><p>We
            or our
            service providers may collect the above categories of information for the following business or commercial
            purposes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Our or our service provider’s operational purposes;</li>
                <li>Auditing consumer interactions on our site;</li>
                <li>Detecting, protecting against, and prosecuting security incidents and fraudulent or illegal
                    activity;
                </li>
                <li>Bug detection and error reporting;</li>
                <li>Customizing content that we or our service providers display on the Online Services;</li>
                <li>Providing the Online Services (e.g., account servicing and maintenance, order processing and
                    fulfillment,
                    customer service, advertising and marketing, analytics, and communication about the Online
                    Services);
                </li>
                <li>Improving the Online Services and developing new services (e.g., by conducting research to develop
                    new
                    products or features);
                </li>
                <li>Other uses that advance our commercial or economic interests, such as third party advertising and

                <li>Other uses about which we notify you.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We may also use the above categories of personal information for compliance with applicable laws and
                regulations,
                and we may combine the information we collect (“aggregate”) or remove pieces of information
                (“de-identify”) to
                limit or prevent identification of any particular user or device.</p><p>We describe our information
            sharing
            practices in our Privacy Policy. We may share certain categories of personal information with third parties
            for
            business purposes. For example, we may share identifiers and other information that identifies or can
            reasonably be
            associated with you with counterparties to your agreements. We may share identifiers with our marketing
            partners,
            and we may also share any of the categories described above with our subsidiaries and affiliates. If you
            connect
            your account with social media services or interact with social media plugins or links on the Online
            Service, we may
            share identifiers, commercial information, internet or other network or device activity, or general location
            with
            those social media services.</p><p><strong>Consumer Rights</strong></p><p>If you are a California resident,
            you may
            have certain rights. California law may permit you to request that we:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Provide you the categories of personal information we have collected or disclosed about you in the
                    last
                    twelve months; the categories of sources of such information; the business or commercial purpose for
                    collecting or selling your personal information; and the categories of third parties with whom we
                    shared
                    personal information.
                </li>
                <li>Provide access to and/or a copy of certain information we hold about you.</li>
                <li>Delete certain information we have about you.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>You also have the right to not be discriminated against (as provided for in applicable law) for
                exercising
                certain of your rights. Certain information may be exempt from such requests under applicable law. We
                need
                certain types of information so that we can provide the Online Services to you. If you ask us to delete
                it, you
                may no longer be able to access or use the Online Services.</p><p>In instances where we process personal
            information on behalf of our customer, rights requests should be directed to the relevant customer. Any
            request sent
            directly to us that pertains to information collected on behalf of a customer will be forwarded on to that
            customer.</p><p>If you would like to exercise any of these rights, you can submit a request at <a
            href="mailto:legal@ironcladhq.com">legal@ironcladhq.com</a>, or through <a href="https://pact.ly/fN7m49"><u>
            <span>the form here</span></u></a>. You will be required to verify your identity
            before
            we fulfill your request. To do so, you will need to provide information to match with our existing records
            to verify
            your identity, depending on the nature of the request and the sensitivity of the information sought. You can
            also
            designate an authorized agent to make a request on your behalf. To do so, you must provide us with written
            authorization or a power of attorney, signed by you, for the agent to act on your behalf. You will still
            need to
            verify your identity directly with us.</p><p><strong>“Sale” of Personal Information</strong></p>
            <p>California
                residents may opt out of the "sale" of their personal information. The CCPA broadly defines "sale" in a
                way that may
                include allowing third parties to receive certain information such as cookie identifiers, IP addresses
                and/or
                browsing behavior to add to a profile about your device, browser or you. Such profiles may enable
                delivery of
                interest-based advertising by such third parties within their platform or on other sites.</p>
            <p>Depending on how you
                use the Service, we may share the following categories of information for such interest-based
                advertising, which may
                be considered a “sale” as defined by the CCPA: identifiers (such as IP address, device identifiers, and
                cookies) and
                internet and device activity. For information on how you can control or opt of such tracking
                technologies, see the
                “Analytics &amp; Advertising” section above.</p><p><strong>California Shine the Light</strong></p><p>We
            do not share
            personal information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes.</p><p><strong><span

            children

            Children’s
            Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA)) from children under 13. If we discover that an individual under 13
            has
            provided us with personal information, we will delete the personal information to the extent required by
            COPPA.</p>
            <p>We do not knowingly process data of EU residents under the age of 16 without parental consent. If we
                become aware

                take
                reasonable steps to delete it as soon as possible.</p><p><strong><span>Changes to this Policy</span></strong>
